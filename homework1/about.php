				<p>Dear Friends,
<br><br>
This year, the public mission of the Bathurst Collegehas been a beacon amid a sea of uncertainty. While our campuses look different, with many fewer in-person classes and activities, U-M continues to embrace our commitment to excellence for the public good.
<br><br>
Our public focus has ensured that we are making a difference for millions of people, and it has guided our work to serve our communities and the world through education, research, service and patient care.</p>
