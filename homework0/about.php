			<h1>Our Story</h1>
			<p>My first airline was started out of frustration. As a young record executive, I travelled the world flying by other airlines, but found the experience dreadful. So in 1984 I chartered one second-hand Boeing 747 and offered flights between London and New York. People thought we were mad and bound to fail quickly. Instead, we focused our airline on the touches so many travellers were looking for: better food, better entertainment, flat beds in Upper Class. And we built a loyal following. That airline was Virgin Atlantic, and today it is still thriving when nearly all of its original rivals have gone under.</p>
